The main purpose of this research is to investigate the relationship between a nation's economic standing and life expectancy. The research question being addressed is whether a nation's economic status has an impact on life expectancy and what variables most accurately predict life expectancy in the given dataset.

The methods used to investigate this question involve the use of R programming language for statistical computation and design. The dataset used contains 2938 observations for 193 countries, which can be classified as either developed or developing. The relationship between life expectancy and a subset of 22 variables, including status, adult mortality, infant mortality, Hepatitis B, BMI, GDP, population, income composition of resources, and schooling, is examined. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to check for null values and potential outliers in the data. The data is also summarized through five summary statistics and histograms to understand the distribution of the data. Further, trends in global life expectancy over the past decade and a half are examined to understand the impact of efforts to promote healthier lifestyles and medical care on life expectancy. Finally, the relationship between a country's status and life expectancy is graphically analyzed.
